Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   Get a USB drive of at least 8GB
   Download the media creation tool from microsoft website
   Click on installation
   Select preferred language, Edition, and Architecture
   Select USB flah drive
   Shut down the system
   Turn on the computer and follow the instruction on the splash screen
   From the options, drag the USb all the way to the top, save and exit

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

   Go to your browser and search for visual studio code
   Choose your device and download
   Go to your downloads to install

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   Go to your web browser and search for Git
   Click on download for windows(64 bit)
   Set up the installation
   select Destination location
   select menu folder
   Choose the default editor used by Git
   Adjust the name of the initial branch in new repositories
   Adjust your Path environment
   Select HTTPS Transport Backend
   Configure the line Ecding Conversions
   Choose the default Behaviour of Gill Pull
   Choose a Credential Helper
   Select Additional Options
   Complete installation

   Open Git bash 
   Navigate to Project Directory
   Initialize the Git repository
   Add files to your repository
   Commit your changes

   login to Github
   Create a Repository on Github 
   Connect to a remote repository on Github
   Push your changes to Github
   


4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  Select the python version to download
  Click on install now
  Double-click the executable file which is downloaded
  Select customizes installation and proceed
  Click on the Add Path check box, It will set the python automatically


5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   Download get-pip.py
   Run python get-pip.py
   Verify pip installation using pip --version
   Use pip to install python packages as needed

   To install package uses pip on python: python -m pip install Django


6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Go to your browser and download the MySql supported by your windows
   Click on server only for custom setup
   Configure MySql server on windows
   Authentication method
   Account and roles
   windows service
   Logging options
   Advanced option
   Apply configuration


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   Install a virtualBox from the official virtualBox website
   Download an ISO file of the desired operating system
   Create a new virtual machine in virtuallbox
   Configure the virtual machine settings and attach the ISO file
   Start the virtualmachine and install the operating system

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
   

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    Setting up developer Environment Documentation
    This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up developer environment, including the installation and configuration of necessary tools and software. This guide is divided into several sections to cover each step of the stepup process.
